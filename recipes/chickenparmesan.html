    <h2> Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken parmesan, or chicken parmigiana, is a crispy fried chicken breast 
        that is baked in a tomato sauce then topped with melted mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese.
        Chicken parmesan is an Italian-American riff on melanzane alla Parmigiana (also known as eggplant parmesan)
        and a traditional preparation of breaded and fried veal cutlets called cotoletta, which is served without 
        sauce or melted cheese. You can serve chicken parmesan with crusty, buttery garlic bread to soak up all the red 
        sauce and melted cheese. You can also serve it with another Americana favorite, the caesar salad. For an easy way
        to incorporate your daily serving of veggies, serve chicken parmesan over fresh zucchini noodles. In countries like Australia, chicken parmesan is served with 
        a side of fries and a green salad, but in North America, the format is a little looser: Chicken parmesan can be served as a standalone 
        dish, tucked into a sandwich, or as a saucy, savory showpiece on a bed of cooked angel hair pasta (or any other noodle of choice). </p>
