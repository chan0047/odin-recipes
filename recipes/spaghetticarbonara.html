    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, accentuated with crisp bits of guanciale,
            and finished with a shower of grated aged Pecorino Romano cheese plus freshly ground black pepper. While it is also made with fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, 
            spaghetti remains the canonical carbonara pasta shape, and the classic recipe contains no butter, cream, or garlic. Carbonara is most associated with Rome and the Lazio region, 
            but as with so many Italian dishes, in Italy, its origin provokes much speculation and debate. Some connect it to pasta cacio e uova, a Neapolitan dish of pasta tossed with melted lard,
            beaten raw eggs, and cheese, as documented in Ippolito Cavalcanti's 1839 Neapolitan cookbook. Because the name comes from the word carbonaro, “coal burner,” some believe the dish was 
            created as a hearty easy-to-make meal by men working outdoors for long periods. Others trace it to the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944, with American GIs bringing their daily ration of 
            eggs and bacon to local restaurants to add to the limited Italian menu. Supporting this story is the first written reference to the dish in newspaper La Stampa in 1950, describing it as a
            dish prized by American servicemen. Shortly after, carbonara also appears in Elizabeth David's classic 1954 book Italian Food.</p>
