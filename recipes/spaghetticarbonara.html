    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, accentuated with crisp bits of guanciale,
            and finished with a shower of grated aged Pecorino Romano cheese plus freshly ground black pepper. While it is also made with fettuccine, linguine, or bucatini, 
            spaghetti remains the canonical carbonara pasta shape, and the classic recipe contains no butter, cream, or garlic. Carbonara is most associated with Rome and the Lazio region, 
            but as with so many Italian dishes, in Italy, its origin provokes much speculation and debate. Some connect it to pasta cacio e uova, a Neapolitan dish of pasta tossed with melted lard,
            beaten raw eggs, and cheese, as documented in Ippolito Cavalcanti's 1839 Neapolitan cookbook. Because the name comes from the word carbonaro, “coal burner,” some believe the dish was 
            created as a hearty easy-to-make meal by men working outdoors for long periods. Others trace it to the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944, with American GIs bringing their daily ration of 
            eggs and bacon to local restaurants to add to the limited Italian menu. Supporting this story is the first written reference to the dish in newspaper La Stampa in 1950, describing it as a
            dish prized by American servicemen. Shortly after, carbonara also appears in Elizabeth David's classic 1954 book Italian Food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>        
    <ul>
        <li>100g pancetta</li>
        <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>350g spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 plump garlic cloves</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put large saucepan of water on to boil</li>
        <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.
            Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together
        </li>
        <li> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated
            black pepper. Set everything aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon salt to boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to boil,
            cook at a constant simmer, covered for 10 minutes or until al dente(just cooked)
        </li>
        <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with blade of knife, just to bruise it</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan
            or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.
            The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard
        </li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low, When the pasta is ready, 
            lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
            Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well and don't throw the pasta water away yet</li>
        <li> Mix most of the cheese in with the egg, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later</li>
        <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. 
            Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, 
            and everything is coated.</li>
        <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). 
            You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
        </ol>
