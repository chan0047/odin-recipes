    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake is a thin, flat, circular piece of cooked batter made from milk, flour, and eggs. Pancakes are often rolled up or folded 
    and eaten hot with a sweet or savoury filling inside. In America, pancakes are usually eaten for breakfast, with butter and maple syrup.
    Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just 
    a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> 1/2 kosher salt</li>
        <li> 3/4 cups whole buttmermilk</li>
        <li> 3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, plus more for griddle </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together buttermilk and eggs 
            in a separate bowl; gradually stir into flour mixture. Gently stir in butter. Let stand 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a buttered griddle to 350Â°F.</li>
        <li>Working in 5 batches, spoon 8 pancakes onto hot griddle using a 1 1/2-inch scoop (about 2 tablespoons per pancake). Cook pancakes until tops 
            are covered with bubbles and edges look dry, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Set pancakes aside until ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
