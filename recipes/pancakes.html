    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake is a thin, flat, circular piece of cooked batter made from milk, flour, and eggs. Pancakes are often rolled up or folded 
    and eaten hot with a sweet or savoury filling inside. In America, pancakes are usually eaten for breakfast, with butter and maple syrup.
    Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just 
    a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
